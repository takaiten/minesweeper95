# Minesweeper95
## What
This is my simple implementation of a minesweeper game using React with hooks and [React95](https://github.com/arturbien/React95) UI components. The goal of this project is to renew my knowledge in Typescript with React. This was created in just one evening. So still **WIP**.

TODO list:  
- [ ] No way to restart the game
- [ ] No way to win the game 
- [ ] Mobile right click support 
- [ ] More?..
